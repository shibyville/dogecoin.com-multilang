You have to sync with the blockchain to use Dogecoin. <br/>This means, you need the Dogecoin "ledger" to use Dogecoin.
CHOOSE_WALLET_DIFFERENCE_P1 : You have to sync with the blockchain to use Dogecoin. <br/>This means, you need the Dogecoin "ledger" to use Dogecoin.
CHOOSE_WALLET_DIFFERENCE_P2 : MultiDoge is a "light" wallet. It syncs with the blockchain by "skimming" through the blockchain, providing fast sync times.
CHOOSE_WALLET_DIFFERENCE_P3 : Dogecoin Core, on the other hand, is a "full" wallet. It syncs by downloading it, providing a solid-working Dogecoin wallet.
CHOOSE_WALLET_ADVANTAGES : Advantages and Disadvantages?
CHOOSE_WALLET_ADVANTAGES_P1 : Both wallets have their advantages and disadvantages.
CHOOSE_WALLET_ADVANTAGES_P2 : MultiDoge is a light wallet, so it only needs to "skim" through the blockchain before it becomes usable. This is done quickly.
CHOOSE_WALLET_ADVANTAGES_P3 : But the wallet should only be for normal use. It <strong>cannot</strong> be used to mine Dogecoin, as the wallet will become slow and unresponsive if used this way.
CHOOSE_WALLET_ADVANTAGES_P4 : Dogecoin Core on the other hand, downloads the entire blockchain. Its initial sync is significantly slower compared to MultiDoge, and it takes up a lot more space.
CHOOSE_WALLET_ADVANTAGES_P5 : But this comes at an advantage. It is safe to mine Dogecoin with this wallet, as it will be able to handle the transactions from payouts. It will also help maintain the Dogecoin network.
